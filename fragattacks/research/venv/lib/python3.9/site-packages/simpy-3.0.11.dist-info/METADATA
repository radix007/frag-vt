SimPy
=====

SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard
Python. Processes in SimPy are defined by Python `generator`__ functions and
can, for example, be used to model active components like customers, vehicles or
agents.  SimPy also provides various types of shared resources to model
limited capacity congestion points (like servers, checkout counters and
tunnels).

Simulations can be performed “as fast as possible”, in real time (wall clock
time) or by manually stepping through the events.

Though it is theoretically possible to do continuous simulations with SimPy, it
has no features that help you with that. Also, SimPy is not really required for
simulations with a fixed step size and where your processes don’t interact with
each other or with shared resources.

The `documentation`__ contains a `tutorial`__, `several guides`__ explaining key
concepts, a number of `examples`__ and the `API reference`__.

SimPy is released under the MIT License. Simulation model developers are
encouraged to share their SimPy modeling techniques with the SimPy community.
Please post a message to the `SimPy mailing list`__.

There is an introductory talk that explains SimPy’s concepts and provides some
examples: `watch the video`__ or `get the slides`__.

A Simple Example
----------------

One of SimPy's main goals is to be easy to use. Here is an example for a simple
SimPy simulation: a *clock* process that prints the current simulation time at
each step:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import simpy
    >>>
    >>> def clock(env, name, tick):
    ...     while True:
    ...         print(name, env.now)
    ...         yield env.timeout(tick)
    ...
    >>> env = simpy.Environment()
    >>> env.process(clock(env, 'fast', 0.5))
    <Process(clock) object at 0x...>
    >>> env.process(clock(env, 'slow', 1))
    <Process(clock) object at 0x...>
    >>> env.run(until=2)
    fast 0
    slow 0
    fast 0.5
    slow 1
    fast 1.0
    fast 1.5


Installation
------------

SimPy requires Python 2.7, 3.2, PyPy 2.0 or above.

You can install SimPy easily via `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -U simpy

You can also download and install SimPy manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd where/you/put/simpy/
    $ python setup.py install

To run SimPy’s test suite on your installation, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ py.test --pyargs simpy


Getting started
---------------

If you’ve never used SimPy before, the `SimPy tutorial`__ is a good starting
point for you. You can also try out some of the `Examples`__ shipped with
SimPy.

Documentation and Help
----------------------

You can find `a tutorial`__, `examples`__, `topical guides`__ and an `API
reference`__, as well as some information about `SimPy and its history`__ in
our `online documentation`__. For more help, contact the `SimPy mailing
list`__. SimPy users are pretty helpful. You can, of course, also dig through
the `source code`__.

If you find any bugs, please post them on our `issue tracker`__.

3.0 – 2013-10-11
----------------

SimPy 3 has been completely rewritten from scratch. Our main goals were to
simplify the API and code base as well as making SimPy more flexible and
extensible. Some of the most important changes are:

- Stronger focus on events. Processes yield event instances and are suspended
  until the event is triggered. An example for an event is a *timeout*
  (formerly known as *hold*), but even processes are now events, too (you can
  wait until a process terminates).

- Events can be combined with ``&`` (and) and ``|`` (or) to create
  *condition events*.

- Process can now be defined by any generator function. You don't have to
  subclass ``Process`` anymore.

- No more global simulation state. Every simulation stores its state in an
  *environment* which is comparable to the old ``Simulation`` class.

- Improved resource system with newly added resource types.

- Removed plotting and GUI capabilities. `Pyside`__ and `matplotlib`__ are much
  better with this.

- Greatly improved test suite. Its cleaner, and the tests are shorter and more
  numerous.

- Completely overhauled documentation.

There is a `guide for porting from SimPy 2 to SimPy 3`__. If you want to stick
to SimPy 2 for a while, change your requirements to ``'SimPy>=2.3,<3'``.

All in all, SimPy has become a framework for asynchronous programming based on
coroutines. It brings more than ten years of experience and scientific know-how
in the field of event-discrete simulation to the world of asynchronous
programming and should thus be a solid foundation for everything based on an
event loop.
